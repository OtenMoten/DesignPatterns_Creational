# DesignPatterns_Creational
This is the first public release of my library that contains various creational design patterns, especially for Java.  

Any code must be understandably, clearly and reusable.  

You will find the creational design patterns in the "src"-directory. Within the directory, every folder represents a creational design pattern.  

Feel free to contribute.
